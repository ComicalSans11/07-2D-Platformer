# Project-Template-Godot


For this project, we made a 2D platformer in Godot. I was not able to figure out how to implement the save and load function, nor how to report score and health. There's also no death screen so you will have to exit the game and restart it if you want to retry. Otherwise, use WASD and the spacebar to move around and jump from platform to platform to get to the exit and move on to the next level. There are only 2 levels. Enemies are hostile and unkillable! Be careful!
